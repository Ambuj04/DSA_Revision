## Core Patterns
-Backtracking is a recursive technique where we build a solution step-by-step and undo choices when constraints are violated.
-Types 
-Decision Backtracking
→ Checks if at least one valid solution exists.
Enumeration Backtracking
→ Generates all possible valid solutions.
Optimization Backtracking
→ Finds the best solution (min / max).
Constraint Satisfaction Backtracking (CSP)
→ Every step must satisfy given constraints.
Incremental Construction Backtracking
→ Builds solution gradually; backtracks on invalid partial state.
Backtracking with Pruning
→ Skips branches that cannot lead to a solution.
## Edge Cases
## My Common Mistakes
## Anchor Problems
Ex: Subset Sum (existence), Rat in a Maze.
Ex: Permutations, Combinations, N-Queens (all).
Ex: Knapsack, TSP.
Ex: Sudoku, Graph Coloring, N-Queens.
Ex: Balanced Parentheses, Combination Sum.
Ex: Branch & Bound, Optimized N-Queens
