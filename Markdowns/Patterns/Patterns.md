## Core Pattern Logic
- Output depends on **row number**
- Each row has a **fixed relationship** between:
  - spaces
  - stars / numbers
- Formula must be derived BEFORE coding

---

## Key Invariants (Must Hold)
- Outer loop = rows
- Inner loop = columns (spaces / stars)
- Each row prints exactly once → endl mandatory
- Pattern symmetry must remain intact

---

## Pattern Families (Same Logic, Different Form)
- Half Pyramid
- Full Pyramid
- Diamond
- Butterfly
- Hollow Variants
- Floyd’s Triangle

(Logic same → formula differs)

---

## Edge Case Triggers (Think Before Coding)
- Does pattern start with **space or symbol**?
- Are rows = columns or different?
- Is symmetry required?
- Does value depend on:
  - row?
  - column?
  - row + column?
  - row − column?

---

## My High-Risk Mistakes (Observed)
- Not identifying rows vs columns first
- Writing code before deriving formula
- Copy-pasting loops instead of generalizing
- Forgetting endl after each row
- Using trial-and-error instead of structure

---

## Prevention Rules (Non-Negotiable)
- First write:
  - total rows
  - total columns per row
- Derive formula on paper
- No coding without formula
- No duplicate loops without reasoning

## Anchor Problems (Mental Reference)
- Pyramid
- Diamond
- Butterfly
- Hollow Diamond
- Prism Triangle
- Floyd’s Triangle
